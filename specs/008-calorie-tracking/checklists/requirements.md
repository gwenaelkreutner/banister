# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily Calorie Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All three clarifications resolved by the user (2026-09-15): FR-009 = recap replaces existing meal
  entries for that day; FR-012 = LLM general knowledge only, no external nutrition database; FR-013 =
  fully standalone for v1, no integration with `/recap` or training context. Added FR-014 (evening
  reminder ~22:00) and an indefinite-retention assumption per explicit user request.
